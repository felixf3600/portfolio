# Portfolio

this is a site that will link up to my various accounts and repositories (code and photos), as well as a description of who I am.

## technologies used

I have used what I learned of CSS, Javascript and HTML.

## problems encountered

Time constraint as I had to start this after fixing up the issues I had with past projects. Also looking for stock photos to use for the different sections.

## work in progress

this is a work in progess as I still need to ad more info and styling. Also just realize that the image files are too big and I will need to shrink them.
