              <p>As a kid I was always interested in how things work and as I was growing up my love for computer games started blossemed into an education in Computer System Technology at BCIT. Unfortunately, my father fell ill and passed away shortly after my first year on the program and I had to drop the program and go back to the family business. This was after taking classes in Basic, C, C++, LISP, Prolog and object oriented programing.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>In my previous job as a Laundry Repair Technician, I had to use logic every day as I    troubleshoot various problems. Here is one example:<br/>
              The company installed brand new machines in a location. From the first day one machine was leaking so they send Technicians to look at the issue. They changed parts and they eventually changed the machine for the customer. Unfortunately, the machine kept on leaking. I was a new Technician at that time and the service manager was new as well so I was the last one they asked to look at it. I went in, took 10 minutes to look at the machine, noticed the water dripping on the inside wall of the machine, and told them to turn the air conditioning down. What was happening was that the location had really hod water coming into their washers and one of the air conditioning vents was aimed onto the top of the machine, hence creating condensation and the perception of a leak. </p>

              <p>I love boardgames. Games now a days have different mixtures of mechanics making each game needing different logics and tactics. By playing different games, I get the chance of applying different thinking strategies and outside of the box thinking. I try to spend at least 1 evening a week playing games.  </p>
